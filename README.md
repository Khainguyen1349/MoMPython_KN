# MoMPython_KN
Try to translate Matlab code from Makarov book into python

As the Jupiter notebooks have some dynamic figures, it is suggested to check the notbook with

https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/

* For example, one can copy the link of the RWG_IFA notebook and add to viewer to open

https://nbviewer.org/github/Khainguyen1349/MoMPython_KN/blob/main/RWG_IFA.ipynb

A second version with denser mesh is also presented in the project.

* Lumped components analysis on a Dipole antenna @75MHz:

* Directivity improvement with lumped components:

* Simulation for a Yagi antenna which functions at 1Ghz:

https://nbviewer.org/github/Khainguyen1349/MoMPython_KN/blob/main/RWG_Yagi_1GHz.ipynb

* Analysis of Charateristic Modes of a conductive plate:

The surface currents and radiation pattern associated are very useful for certain types of design, e.g. Capacitive Coupling Element design for mobile terminals, etc.

Have fun!
